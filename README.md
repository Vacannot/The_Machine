# The_Machine
Small HTML &amp; JS browser game

Explore the mine as the Machine forces you to work until you find "The Gem".
Stay safe down there, you're going to need every ounce of strength that you can muster.

This project was part of an assignment in which i had to create a textbased game that uses prompts and alerts.

If i were to redo the project then i would have done it differently, some implementaions of the different ores work would have been different.
But considering i've never done something like this before i'm happy with how it turned out. I didn't know how i was going to do most things until i figured it out half way in.

Play the game on GitHub Pages here: https://vacannot.github.io/The_Machine/
